# mindX (Augmentic Intelligence) - Web3 & Self-Funding Vision
This document outlines the strategic development roadmap for the MindX system. It is a living document, intended to be reviewed and potentially updated by the MindX system itself as its capabilities evolve.
Our Guiding Vision: To create a robust, secure, and increasingly autonomous AI system (MindX) that can intelligently manage its own evolution, improve its capabilities, enhance its efficiency, explore novel operational paradigms including decentralized ecosystems, and ultimately contribute to solving complex problems.
Phase I: Foundational Stability & Core Self-Improvement Loop (RC1 - Current)
(Objective: Establish a stable, observable, and minimally self-improving system with secure identity primitives.)
Milestone 1.1: Robust Core Agent Operations (Complete in RC1)
Stable CoordinatorAgent for task orchestration and SIA CLI invocation.
Functional SelfImprovementAgent (SIA) with safe single-file modification, self-testing for its own updates, versioned backups, and CLI rollback.
Reliable Config, Logging, LLMFactory, and BeliefSystem utilities.
Functional ResourceMonitor and PerformanceMonitor providing basic telemetry.
Functional StrategicEvolutionAgent (SEA) capable of managing simple, single-target improvement campaigns via Coordinator/SIA.
Functional MastermindAgent capable of setting broad directives and utilizing an IDManagerAgent for basic cryptographic identity provisioning (e.g., Ethereum-style key pairs for internal agent/tool identification).
Milestone 1.2: Basic Autonomous Improvement Cycle (RC1 Goal)
CoordinatorAgent's autonomous loop can perform system analysis, populate a backlog, and attempt simple, non-critical improvements from the backlog via SIA.
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for all critical component changes is functional and enforced.
Basic cool-down mechanism for failed backlog items.
Milestone 1.3: Enhanced Observability & Reporting (Target: RC1.1)
PerformanceMonitor: More granular metrics.
CoordinatorAgent: CLI commands for detailed status views.
BeliefSystem: More structured belief logging.
Basic automated system health & improvement summary reporting.
Milestone 1.4: SIA Evaluation Enhancement (Target: RC1.2)
SIA: Integrate basic static analysis for external file changes.
SIA: Improve LLM critique prompts.
Coordinator: Better parsing and belief update from SIA's detailed evaluation.
Milestone 1.5: Research On-Chain Identity Representation (Conceptual - Mastermind/SEA) (Target: RC1.3 - New)
Mastermind/SEA BDI Action: ANALYZE_BLOCKCHAIN_IDENTITY_STANDARDS.
Objective: Investigate methods and standards for representing MindX agents or components as on-chain entities using identities from IDManagerAgent. Explore ENS, ERC-725, or similar concepts for feasibility.
Output: A report (belief/document) on potential approaches, benefits, and challenges.
Phase II: Deepening Intelligence & Operational Autonomy (Target: RC2)
(Objective: Enhance strategic decision-making, improve learning from past actions, increase operational autonomy, and explore foundational Web3 interactions.)
Milestone 2.1: Intelligent Backlog Prioritization & Selection (SEA/Coordinator)
LLM-driven scoring and re-prioritization of the improvement_backlog.
Milestone 2.2: Learning from Improvement Outcomes (SEA/Mastermind)
Systematic recording and use of detailed SIA modification outcomes to inform future LLM prompts and avoid repeated failures.
Milestone 2.3: Advanced Plan Monitoring & Replanning (BDI agents within SEA/Mastermind)
More robust plan validity checks and LLM-assisted replanning with failure context.
Milestone 2.4: Proactive Resource Management (Coordinator/ResourceMonitor)
Monitor callbacks trigger more specific Coordinator actions.
Milestone 2.5: Rudimentary Multi-File Change Capability (SIA & SEA/Coordinator)
SIA: Conceptual CLI extension for multi-file change manifests.
SEA/Coordinator: LLM-driven planning for multi-file refactoring tasks.
Milestone 2.6: Smart Contract Interaction Primitives (Conceptual - New Tool/SIA Task) (Target: RC2.1 - New)
Mastermind/SEA BDI Action: DEVELOP_TOOL_SMART_CONTRACT_READER.
Objective: Task SIA (via Coordinator) to develop a new, simple Python tool within MindX (mindx/tools/blockchain_reader.py) capable of reading basic public data from a specified smart contract on a test network (e.g., token balance, simple state variable).
This tool would use a standard library like web3.py. The IDManagerAgent might provide a read-only identity if needed for RPC node access.
Milestone 2.7: Research Decentralized Storage for Beliefs/Artifacts (Conceptual - Mastermind/SEA) (Target: RC2.2 - New)
Mastermind/SEA BDI Action: EVALUATE_DECENTRALIZED_STORAGE_OPTIONS.
Objective: Investigate feasibility of using IPFS, Arweave, or similar for storing certain MindX beliefs, code snapshots, or documentation artifacts for enhanced resilience or verifiability.
Output: Feasibility report and prototype plan if viable.
Phase III: Towards Emergent Evolution & Decentralized Operation (Target: RC3 / MindX v1.0)
(Objective: Enable MindX to set more of its own strategic goals, develop genuinely new capabilities, explore self-funding mechanisms, and operate components within a decentralized framework.)
Milestone 3.1: Autonomous Goal Refinement & Generation (Mastermind/SEA)
MastermindAgent's BDI loop uses LLM to analyze long-term system performance and generate new strategic campaign goals.
Milestone 3.2: "Agent/Tool Genesis" - Initial Implementation (Mastermind, Coordinator, SIA)
Mastermind BDI Action INITIATE_NEW_COMPONENT_DEVELOPMENT leads to SIA creating basic structures for new tools/agents.
Milestone 3.3: Cloud Deployment Self-Management (Coordinator/SIA - Google Cloud Run Focus)
SIA output triggers CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment of updated Cloud Run services.
Milestone 3.4: Conceptual Self-Funding Agent - Phase Alpha (Research & Design - Mastermind/SEA) (Target: RC3.1 - New)
Mastermind BDI Action: DESIGN_SELF_FUNDING_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.
Objective:
Research mechanisms for an AI agent to autonomously manage crypto assets and interact with DeFi protocols or service marketplaces.
Design a SelfFundingAgent (conceptual Python class structure within MindX). This agent would be responsible for deploying smart contracts, managing a treasury, and potentially offering services.
Concept: S.M.A.I.R.T. Presale: As part of the design, explore a "Strategic Modular AI Resource Token" (S.M.A.I.R.T.) presale or similar tokenomic model as a conceptual mechanism for bootstrapping initial resources. This is purely a design exercise at this stage.
Output: A detailed design document and a stub implementation of SelfFundingAgent within mindx/agents/. IDManagerAgent would provide its core identity.
Milestone 3.5: Conceptual DAIO Framework Integration - Phase Alpha (Research & Design - Mastermind/SEA) (Target: RC3.2 - New)
Mastermind BDI Action: DESIGN_DAIO_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.
Objective:
Research existing DAO/DAIO frameworks (Aragon, DAOstack, custom smart contracts).
Design how MindX, or a specialized version of it, could operate as or within a Decentralized Autonomous Intelligent Organization (DAIO).
Consider governance mechanisms, proposal systems for MindX's self-improvements, and how the SelfFundingAgent's treasury might be managed by DAIO Gating or voting.
Output: A whitepaper/design document outlining a potential MindX-DAIO architecture.
Milestone 3.6: Secure On-Chain Agent Registration (Conceptual - IDManagerAgent, Mastermind) (Target: RC3.3 - New)
Mastermind BDI Action: DEVELOP_ONCHAIN_REGISTRY_INTERACTION.
Objective: Task SIA (via Coordinator) to enhance the IDManagerAgent or create a new tool that allows MindX (via Mastermind or other authorized agents) to register its core agent identities (or specific tool identities) on a public testnet blockchain using a simple registry smart contract (e.g., mapping bytes32 (agent_id_hash) to address).
This would be a step towards verifiable on-chain presence.
Phase IV: Advanced Autonomy, Decentralization & Expansion (Beyond RC3 / Future Vision)
True emergent goal generation by MastermindAgent.
Deployment of SelfFundingAgent v1.0: (Conceptual) The SelfFundingAgent, using its provisioned identity and following its LLM-refined strategy, attempts to deploy a simple utility smart contract (e.g., a data oracle, a simple prediction market interface) or offer a micro-service on a decentralized marketplace. It manages any (simulated or real testnet) funds generated.
MindX-DAIO v1.0 Launch (Conceptual): Establishment of a DAIO where token holders (S.M.A.I.R.T. if that concept is pursued) can vote on MindX development priorities, funding allocations from the SelfFundingAgent's treasury, or even specific self-improvement proposals.
Self-replication or specialization of MindX agents for new problem domains.
Dynamic self-reconfiguration of the agent network itself based on DAIO governance and system performance.
MindX contributes to its own ROADMAP.md updates directly.
