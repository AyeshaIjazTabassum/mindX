## Issue Analysis and Resolution

### Identified Issue: Evolution Campaign Path Error

**Problem**: BDI agent attempted to use placeholder path `'path/to/summarization/tool'` instead of actual path `'tools'`

**Root Cause**: Configuration placeholder not replaced with actual system path

**Impact**: Non-critical - System operational, evolution campaigns need path correction

**Resolution Status**: ✅ **IDENTIFIED AND SOLVABLE**

**Recommended Fix**:
```json
// In BDI agent planning, replace:
"root_path_str": "path/to/summarization/tool"
// With:
"root_path_str": "tools"
```

### Tool Loading Issues (Non-Critical)

**Missing Tools**:
1. `cli_command_tool.CLICommandTool` - Alternative: `shell_command` tool available
2. `augmentic_intelligence_tool` - Missing `log_prefix` attribute

**Impact**: Minimal - Core functionality unaffected, redundant capabilities available
