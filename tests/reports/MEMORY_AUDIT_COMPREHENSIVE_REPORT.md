### Unified Log Structure
All agents now follow a consistent memory logging pattern:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000000",
  "memory_type": "system_state",
  "importance": 3,
  "agent_id": "agent_identifier",
  "content": {
    "process_name": "descriptive_process_name",
    "data": {
      "operation_specific_data": "values",
      "success": true/false,
      "metrics": {},
      "context": {}
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "agent_id": "agent_identifier",
    "run_id": "execution_context"
  },
  "tags": ["process_tag", "category_tag"],
  "parent_memory_id": null,
  "memory_id": "unique_identifier"
}
```

### Process Naming Taxonomy
Established standardized process naming conventions:
- `{agent_type}_{operation}_{status}` format
- Status indicators: `start`, `completed`, `failed`
- Operation categories: `creation`, `validation`, `analysis`, `execution`
